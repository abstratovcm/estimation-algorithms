# estimation-algorithms

The `estimation-algorithms` project aims to provide a collection of estimation methods implemented in C++, including the Kalman filter, particle filter, and other commonly used algorithms. The project is designed to be easily extensible, allowing developers to add their own estimation algorithms to the library.
